# Text-Compression-Utility

This program can compress or decompress a file. 
It takes 3 inputs. 
The first input can be either a 0 or a 1.

In case of inputting 0, which means compression,
the program will ask the user to input the name of the text file that he/she wants to compress 
and the name of the output compressed .bin file. 

In case of inputting 1, which means decompression,
the program will ask the user to input the name of the compressed .bin file that he/she wants to decompress
and the name of the output decompressed file.
